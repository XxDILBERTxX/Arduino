Do you have too many sensors with the same I<sup>2</sup>C address? Put them on the SparkFun Qwiic Mux Breakout to get them all talking on the same bus! The Qwiic Mux Breakout enables communication with multiple I<sup>2</sup>C devices that have the same address that makes it simple to interface with. The Qwiic Mux also has eight configurable addresses of its own, allowing for up to 64 I<sup>2</sup>C buses on a connection. To make it even easier to use this multiplexer, all communication is enacted exclusively via I<sup>2</sup>C, utilizing our handy Qwiic system.

The Qwiic Mux also allows you to change the last three bits of the address byte, allowing for eight jumper selectable addresses if you happen to need to put more than one Qwiic Mux Breakout on the same I<sup>2</sup>C port. The address can be changed by adding solder to any of the three ADR jumpers. Each SparkFun Qwiic Mux Breakout operate between 1.65V and 5.5V making it ideal for all of the Qwiic boards we produce in house.
